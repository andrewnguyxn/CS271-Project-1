#Description: 
This project involves implementing five sorting algorithms in C++, including insertion sort, merge sort, and three variations of quicksort. Each sorting method is designed to efficiently organize an array of elements, showcasing different algorithmic strategies for sorting data, such as median-of-three pivot selection and randomization.

#Methods:
We implemented different sorting algorithm in C++ (insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, improved quicksort, and randomized quicksort).
See directory guide for further information, specifications on these methods. 


#Directory Guide: 
The declaration of sorting algorithm are included in the sorting.hpp file, and detailed documentation specifying the operation, parameters, and return values of each method can be found in the DoublyLinkedList.cpp file. 

The test cases could be found in mytests.cpp. You could run this test by entering make mytests into the terminal.

After running "make mytests" into the terminal; you might see a mytests.o and a mytests file. 
And you could also see if each test cases in each sorting algorithm is correct and total
passed, failed cases.

If you have not make any adjustments, you could run the test again by typing ./mytests

Running "make sorting" on the terminal gives an object file sorting.0

You can clear these objects by entering make clear in the terminal
